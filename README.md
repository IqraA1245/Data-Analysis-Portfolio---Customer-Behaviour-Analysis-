# Data-Analysis-Portfolio---Customer-Behaviour-Analysis-
Industry level full analysis of customer behaviour using Excel, Python , SQL and Power BI


Hi, I’m Iqra. An aspiring data analyst with a passion for uncovering stories hidden within data. I love turning raw numbers into insights that can actually guide smarter decisions.

This project, Customer Shopping Behaviour Analysis, was a great opportunity to explore how data can help businesses better understand their customers and improve marketing strategies. The idea was to take a real-world dataset of over 3,900 purchases and transform it into clear, actionable insights using tools like Python, SQL, and Power BI.

I started by cleaning and preparing the data in Python, integrated it into a SQL database for deeper analysis, and finally visualized the results in an interactive Power BI dashboard. Along the way, I explored questions like:

Which customer segments contribute most to revenue?

Do discounts actually drive higher sales or just lower profits?

How do age, gender, and subscription status affect spending patterns?

The end result is a full analytical pipeline, from raw Excel data to polished business insights — showing how data analytics can directly support decisions around marketing, customer engagement, and product strategy.
